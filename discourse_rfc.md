# Adopting the Discourse as an official communications platform

To better facilitate DM communications and community support, we propose adoption of the Discourse forum platform. A demonstration forum is at http://community.lsst.org and is available right now for anyone to create an account and use. This RFC is to determine if the demonstration forum at community.lsst.org should be designated as an official DM communications channel.

## Background

Fostering effective online communications in DM is important due to the geographical distribution and size of our team. We use a number of tools to fit various communication niches: JIRA, Confluence, Blue Jeans/Google Hangouts, HipChat, email lists, and to a minor extent, GitHub.

We believe that an online forum, of which Discourse is the best platform, will solve many of the pain-points in how HipChat, Confluence and Email Lists are being used now. Note that this RFC is not to deprecate any existing communication tool, but we do expect Discourse will reduce traffic to these tools. Below are specific applications where a forum is better than the existing tools.

### Scalable support

When a new user is introduced to the stack, the primary point of contact for assistance has traditionally been HipChat. While this is fine at our current size, it will become completely untenable once LSST becomes widely used. The fundamental problem is that with HipChat, a user needs to ask the same questions each time because they don't know what to search for in the chat history. With Discourse, questions and answers in the forum will organically (and with curation) become a rich knowledge base for new users in much the same way as StackOverflow is useful even to those who never post questions.

### Scalable community

The HipChat and Confluence platforms are also difficult to scale. Users are centrally created, and DM pays per user. Soon we will need a platform to interact with scientific collaborations, and even entirely external astronomers wishing to use our open source stack. Discourse has no gatekeeper; anyone can create an account and participate in the public parts of the site.

### Conversations that are truly asynchronous and discoverable

A lot of important and useful conversations take place on HipChat, and it can be difficult to keep up. Yes, one can scroll back on the history, but at that point it becomes tedious to sort out topics of relevance. And if a relevant topic was discussed, it may be too late for that person to effectively participate. By organizing discussions into threads, Discourse makes it easy to understand what it being discussed at a glance. Discourse also provides customizable notifications and digest emails to keep everyone up to date.

### Better email list user experience

Email list archives have abysmal user experience. A newcomer cannot expect to find content in an email list archive. Meanwhile, Discourse has fantastic search, offers tagging, and can also function as a mailing list by sending an email if a user 'watches' a category.
